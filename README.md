# Chess

Chess is an awesome game. I'm not good at it, I've never really played it. I found that I always liked the idea of playing chess a lot more than playing chess itself. 

So, why not make as a terminal game! 

It's a great game, it's complexity largely has to do with the playing of the game more than with the game itself.

The game utilizes the powerful object oriented abilities of the ruby langauge in order to create the pieces and the players (whether it's another player or an AI is up to the person playing the game to choose.)

So, if you'd like to play a game of chess, and you wanted to do so on a terminal, you can use this! 

Now, I won't play with you, I don't really like playing chess (as I said above), but, I'd be glad to watch you play chess. :)
